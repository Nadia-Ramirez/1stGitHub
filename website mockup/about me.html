       <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
       <p>My full name is Nadia Yazmin Ramirez. Most call me Nadia. I’m the artist behind Yazmin Designz. I believe every experience is a journey to a new adventure. As a high school
sophomore, both a Visual Arts and Digital Communications major at Cab Calloway School of the Arts, I consider myself an artistic explorer. In my expeditions thus far, I have found a love of traveling, art, communications and being backstage.</p>
<p>Traveling is always so captivating. I am fascinated with different cultures and trying new things. I love the finding the thrill in expiriences, that I can’t find back at home. My love of art comes in a variety of forms like, Jagua/Henna tattoos, murals, and many more. Along with others in which I’m still learning. Digital Communications is what makes up the most of today’s world. Creating digital art such as taking/editing photos and videos, creating logos, graphics, ads and more. Lastly, I enjoy being behind the scenes in the production team. Either directing, running lights, creating props or even being a runner between scenes. Whatever the job is, I love being apart of the team. Especially for the satisfaction at the ends of a successful show.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of my journey today!</p>
